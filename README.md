# xLedger

It allows programs written in Lazarus and Free Pascal to take advantage of alerts, triggers, accounting, analysis and reporting on trading.

Although it can serve many other purposes, it is being developed to be the middleware component of [EƵRA](https://github.com/ezlage/EZRA), the Ezequiel’s Robot for Automated and Algorithmic Trading. In that specific implementation, there are two other related components: [HyperX](https://github.com/ezlage/HyperX), the data communication component; and [Hazard](https://github.com/ezlage/Hazard), the automated and algorithmic trader.

This repository has already been initialized, but it will take some time to receive the initial code.

### Dependencies

- At least one [HyperX](https://github.com/ezlage/HyperX) descendant provided with a wrapper and a parser for some API
- [SQLCipher](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) or similar
- [ZeosDBO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zeoslib/files/Zeos%20Database%20Objects/)

It is possible to use programs other than SQLCipher or SQLite. The chosen architecture and design aim at flexibility and adaptability. There are no intentional limitations, but some changes may be necessary.

### Change log and roadmap

Pending. As already mentioned, this repository has already been initialized, but it will take some time to receive the initial code.
